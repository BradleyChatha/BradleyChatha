Welcome to my ~~project graveyard~~ Github! I've been programming as a hobby for 11 years, and currently work as a DevOps Engineer.

## Projects

I'm really spotty when it comes to supporting my projects, but here's a few of my recent favourites:

* [Juptune](https://github.com/Juptune/juptune) - A medium-level asynchronous I/O library for D.
* [Marmos](https://github.com/Juptune/marmos) - A semi-generic tool for generating documentation from D source code, written in D and TypeScript.
* [deusex-timer](https://github.com/BradleyChatha/deusex-timer) - A speedrun timer for the original Deus Ex, written in D.

Some honorable mentions:

* [Sdlang Initiative](https://github.com/SdlangInitiative) - Provides implementations for [sdlang](https://sdlang.org/) in various languages. Abandoned due to lack of interest (in both sdlang itself and my own interest).
* [JCLI](https://github.com/BradleyChatha/jcli) - A metaprogramming-heavy CLI library for D. I let someone else half-take over since I lost interest, but it's functionally abandoned.
* [Lumars](https://github.com/BradleyChatha/lumars) - Provides a more natural interface between Lua and D. Not fully abandoned, but not a priority for me to spend time on since I have other interesting projects instead.

And then there's the rest of the my Github projects in their various states of completion. 99% of it is just historical trash, but there's a few interesting bits scattered about.
