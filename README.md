Welcome to my ~~project graveyard~~ Github! I've been programming as a hobby for 7 years, and am starting to work towards making it a career. I mostly enjoy writing tools/libraries for others to use, but also have experience with full-stack web development. I am almost completely self-taught; self-motivated, and I am a quick learner.

For native applications, I primarily program in D, whereas for websites I like to use C# and the usual trifecta of HTML/CSS/JS (‚ù§Ô∏è to Vue, TS, and SASS).

For a more in depth overview of my skillset, please visit [my website](https://bradley.chatha.dev/?pk_campaign=github&pk_kwd=skillset) and also take a look at my [CV](https://github.com/BradleyChatha/CV/blob/master/build/cv_generic_modern.pdf).

## Projects

My most notable projects will be listed on the [Projects](https://bradley.chatha.dev/Projects) page of my website, however here are a few more:

* üñ•Ô∏è [JCLI](https://github.com/SealabJaster/jcli/tree/master/source/jaster/cli) - A Command Line Interface library for the D programming language.
* üéÆ [Farm Defense](https://github.com/BradleyChatha/farm_defense) - A small game I'm working on as a side project, mostly to learn Vulkan.

## Blog

I host a blog over at my [website](https://bradley.chatha.dev/Blog?pk_campaign=github&pk_kwd=direct) which contains things like change logs for JCLI, and a metaprogramming tutorial for D.
