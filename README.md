Welcome to my ~~project graveyard~~ Github! I've been programming as a hobby for 7 years, and am starting to work towards making it a career. I mostly enjoy writing tools/libraries for others to use, but also have experience with full-stack web development. I am almost completely self-taught; self-motivated, and I am a quick learner.

## Projects

* 🖥️ [JCLI](https://github.com/SealabJaster/jcli/tree/master/source/jaster/cli) - A Command Line Interface library for the D programming language.
* 🖿 The [Projects](https://bradley.chatha.dev/Projects) page on my website.

As a side project, I'm working on a small game, mostly so I can learn Vulkan.

## Blog

I host a blog over at my [website](https://bradley.chatha.dev/Blog) which contains things like change logs for JCLI, and a metaprogramming tutorial for D.

## Communities

* Sometimes interact with the D community, but most of the time I just embarrass myself.

## Languages

These are the languages I have the most experience with:

* C#
* D
* HTML
* CSS/SASS
* JS/TS

## Technologies

These are some of the libraries; frameworks, and other technologies that I have used:

* ASP Core
* Bootstrap
* DigitalOcean
* Docker
* EF Core
* Git (Of course >:3)
* GraphQL
* Gulp
* Matomo
* Microsoft SQL Server
* Nginx
* Postgresql
* Semantic/Fomantic UI
