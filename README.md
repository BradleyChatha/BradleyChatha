### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Bradley, I primarily program in [D](https://dlang.org/) and C#.

### Projects

My main open source project right now would be [JCLI](https://github.com/SealabJaster/jcli/tree/master/source/jaster/cli) which is a CLI library for D.

### Blog

I host a blog over at my [website](https://bradley.chatha.dev/Blog) which contains things like change logs for JCLI, and a metaprogramming tutorial for D.
